What is Forking in Github?

In layman's terms, "fork" in GitHub refers to making a copy of a repository (a collection of files and code) hosted on GitHub and creating a separate, independent version of it that you can modify and manage on your own. It's like taking a snapshot of a project and creating your own separate copy of it, which you can then customize or contribute to without affecting the original version.

When you "fork" a repository on GitHub, you create a separate copy of that repository under your own GitHub account. You can then clone (download) that copy to your local computer and make changes to it as you wish, such as fixing bugs, adding new features, or making modifications to suit your needs. These changes can be committed and pushed back to your forked repository on GitHub, where they are stored and can be reviewed by others.

Forking is commonly used in open source software development, where multiple people may want to contribute to a project. Forking allows individuals or teams to work on their own versions of a project independently, and then propose their changes back to the original repository through a process called a "pull request." Forking enables collaborative development and fosters community-driven contributions to a project.
